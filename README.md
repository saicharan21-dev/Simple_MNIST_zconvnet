# Simple MNIST ConvNet
This repository contains a simple implementation of a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for the MNIST dataset. The ConvNet is designed to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels, representing handwritten digits. The dataset is preprocessed and split into a training set and a test set to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

## Architecture
The ConvNet architecture used in this implementation consists of multiple layers that extract features from the input images and classify them into different classes. The architecture includes the following layers:

1. Convolutional Layers: These layers apply a set of learnable filters to the input images, enabling the model to learn local patterns and features.
2. Activation Layers: Non-linear activation functions, such as ReLU, are applied element-wise to the output of the convolutional layers to introduce non-linearity into the model.
3. Pooling Layers: These layers downsample the spatial dimensions of the previous layers, reducing computational complexity and providing translational invariance.
4. Fully Connected Layers: The features extracted by the convolutional layers are flattened and fed into fully connected layers, which learn global patterns and make predictions.
5. Softmax Layer: The final layer applies the softmax activation function to produce probability distributions over the classes, determining the predicted digit for each input image.

## Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/PurnaChandar26/Simple-MNIST-ConvNet.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

- pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start training the ConvNet model:

- python train.py

4. (Optional) Evaluate the trained model on the test set:

- python evaluate.py

## Results
After training, the model's performance on the test set will be displayed, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, the model's predictions on a subset of the test set will be visualized to provide insights into its classification capabilities.

## Further Improvements
This repository provides a basic implementation of a ConvNet for MNIST classification. To further enhance the model's performance, consider experimenting with the following techniques:

Adjusting the architecture by adding more convolutional layers or fully connected layers.
Tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, or number of epochs.
Applying regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
Exploring advanced architectures like residual networks or inception networks.
Augmenting the training data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or adding noise to increase the model's robustness.
By iteratively experimenting with different variations and techniques, you can improve the model's accuracy and performance on the MNIST dataset.
